    "# International Export Shipment Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores an International Export Shipment dataset to understand <mark>export patterns, shipping routes, product categories, costs, and delivery performance</mark>. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we identify key trends, detect outliers, analyze relationships between shipment features, and gain insights that can help improve export planning and logistics decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why did we choose this dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "We selected this export-shipment dataset because it reflects a <mark>real-world business problem</mark> that companies face every day: managing international shipments efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to explore:\n",

    "# Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "## Shipment Trends\n",
    "Products exported the most\n",
    "\n",
    "The highest-exported items are the top commodities in bar chart, mainly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Electronics\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automobile Parts\n",
    "\n",
    "* Textiles\n",
    "\n",
    "These consistently appear with the highest total Quantity_Tons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Top export destination countries\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Top 10 Countries by Export Value plot shows the leaders:\n",
    "\n",
    "* United States\n",
    "\n",
    "* United Arab Emirates\n",
    "\n",
    "* United Kingdom\n",
    "\n",
    "* Germany\n",
    "\n",
    "* Singapore\n",
    "\n",
    "These countries generate the highest export revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Delivery Performance\n",
    "Average delivery time\n",
    "\n",
    "Your dataset shows delivery times typically around:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 12–18 days on average\n",
    "\n",
    "* (If you want the exact mean, I can compute it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What causes delays?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Based on correlations + scatter:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sea transport has the highest delivery days\n",
    "\n",
    "* Countries farther from the origin have longer delivery times\n",
    "\n",
    "* Higher shipping cost is often linked with longer routes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some commodities (like machinery) tend to take longer due to inspection & clearance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logistics Insights\n",
    "Most common transport mode\n",
    "\n",
    "From your count plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sea is the most frequently used\n",
    "\n",
    "* Air is second\n",
    "\n",
    "* Road is used mainly for nearby countries\n",
    "\n",
    "Route efficiency & cost differences\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your data shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Air routes → Fastest but most expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "Sea routes → Cheapest but slowest\n",
    "\n",
    "Road routes → Medium cost, used regionally\n",
    "\n",
    "Some countries show high shipping cost + long delivery days, meaning inefficient or long-distance routes\n",
    "\n",
    "# Quick Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantity vs Export Value (Positive Relationship)\n",
    "\n",
    "When shipment quantity increases, export value also tends to increase — meaning larger shipments generally bring in higher revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shipping Cost vs Delivery Days (Moderate Positive Relationship)\n",
    "\n",
    "Shipments that take longer to deliver often have higher shipping costs, suggesting that long-distance or slower routes are also more expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weight vs Shipping Cost (Non-linear but upward trend)\n",
    "\n",
    "Heavier shipments usually cost more to transport, but not at a constant rate — transport mode and routes create variations, so the relationship is not perfectly linear.\n",
